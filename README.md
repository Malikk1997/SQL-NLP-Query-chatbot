# SQL-NLP-Query-chatbot
For NLP SQL Query Chatbot, I utilized Streamlit to quickly and efficiently build the frontend interface. Streamlit is a great choice for rapid development because it allows for simple yet powerful web app creation using Python. This helped you focus on the core functionality of the chatbot without spending too much time on frontend design and logic.

In the backend, I leveraged a GPT large language model (LLM) to handle the crucial task of converting natural language queries (NLQ) into SQL queries. When a user inputs a query in natural language (e.g., “Show all products sold last year”), the GPT model interprets the query and generates the corresponding SQL command. The system then executes the SQL query on the AdventureWorks database, which is a commonly used sample database that contains information about a company's operations (e.g., product sales, employee data, etc.).

Key Features:
Streamlit Frontend: A user-friendly interface where users can easily input their queries.
GPT Model: Converts NLQ into SQL, providing flexibility in interpreting user inputs, even when they use informal or varied language.
AdventureWorks Database Integration: The SQL queries generated by GPT are executed on the AdventureWorks database, returning results such as sales data, customer information, or product listings.
This setup allows for an intuitive and efficient query system, enabling users to interact with complex databases without needing to know SQL. The combination of Streamlit for the UI and GPT for query conversion makes the system both user-friendly and highly functional.
